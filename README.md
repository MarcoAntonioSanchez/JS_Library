# JS CODE LIBRARY
### Made with love from scratch (Nov 2022)
This repository was created for further implementations and/or projects.
The goal is that all my vanilla JavaScript code, previously tested,
resides in blocks of code well docummented, getting the recycling process
a structured and fast way to progress during programming journeys. 

### HOW TO
You can navigate trough the following index, in every sub-level of this
root directory you'll find __**README.md**__ to help you find the desired
piece of code you need.

About the docummentation, every __**.js**__ file haves an appropiate comment
line(s) describing the technical base structure and functionallity.

### INDEX

1. **Scroll to HTML element on click event**
	- This code snippet was writted for a web page full of checkboxes and the requirement was to scroll down to a specific element at the bottom of the page when a checkbox is clicked.
