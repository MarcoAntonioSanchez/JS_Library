### JS CODE LIBRARY

---

#### Made with love from scratch (Nov 2022) :blue_heart:

---

This repository was created for further implementations and/or projects.
The goal is that all my vanilla JavaScript code, previously tested,
resides in blocks of code well docummented, getting the recycling process
a structured and fast way to progress during programming journeys.

#### :arrow_right: HOW TO:

---

First, you can reference to the following index list of titles of functions
and code snippets to help you recycle vanilla JS on your implementations.
In every sub-level of this root directory you'll find **README.md** files
with a base description of the code structure to help you find the
desired piece of code you need.

Secondary, the docummentation on every **.js** file consist in the appropriate
comment line(s) describing the functionallity of the code snippet in form
of a resume pm a technical level.

:one: **Scroll to HTML element on click event.**

- This code snippet was writted for a web page in a WordPress project for a schedule system called **WEBSY** full of checkboxes and the requirement was to scroll down to a specific element at the bottom of the page when a checkbox is clicked. :link:[Click here to see the code](https://github.com/MarcoAntonioSanchez/JS_Library/tree/main/functions/scroll_to_element_on_click_event)
