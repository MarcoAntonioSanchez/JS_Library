# JS CODE LIBRARY

#### Made with love from scratch (Nov 2022) :blue_heart:

---

This repository was created for further implementations and/or projects.
The goal is that all my vanilla JavaScript code, previously tested,
resides in blocks of code well docummented, getting the recycling process
a structured and fast way to progress during programming journeys.

#### HOW TO :grey_question:

---

You can navigate trough the following index, in every sub-level of this
root directory you'll find **README.md** files to help you find the
desired piece of code you need.

About the docummentation, every **.js** file haves an appropiate comment
line(s) describing the technical base structure and functionallity.

#### INDEX :grey_exclamation:

---

:one: **Scroll to HTML element on click event.**

- This code snippet was writted for a web page in a WordPress project for a schedule system called **WEBSY** full of checkboxes and the requirement was to scroll down to a specific element at the bottom of the page when a checkbox is clicked. :link:[Click here to see the code](https://github.com/MarcoAntonioSanchez/JS_Library/tree/main/functions/scroll_to_element_on_click_event)
